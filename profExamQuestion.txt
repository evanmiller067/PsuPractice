Linear linked lists, circular and doubly linked lists:
1. Write a recursive function in C++ to find duplicate data within an existing linked list.
2. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove all nodes in that linked list
3. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove all nodes except the last two nodes
4. Write a recursive function in C++ to add a node to the end but only if it doesn't already exist in the linked list
5. Write a recursive function in C++ to move the last node to the beginning of the linked list
6. Write a recursive function in C++ to make a complete copy of a linked list
7. Write a recursive function in C++ to copy a circular linked list into a linear linked list

Binary search trees:
1. Write a recursive function in C++ to make a copy of a binary search tree
2. Write a recursive function in C++ to make a copy of a binary search tree and place it in a linear linked list, sorted
3. Write a recursive function in C++ to add a node into a binary search tree
4. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove the largest item in a binary search tree
5. Write a recursive function in C++ to remove the largest two items in a binary search tree
6. Write a recursive function in C++ to find the rootâ€™s in-order successor
